# Plant_Leaf_Disease_Detection

Plant diseases continue to be a major challenge for farmers, often leading to reduced crop yields and financial losses. Early detection is key to managing these diseases effectively. In this study, we present a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to classify plant leaf diseases using images from the Mendeley Plant Leaf Disease Dataset. This dataset includes 39 classes of both healthy and diseased leaves and comes pre-augmented to improve learning. Our model uses three convolutional layers, followed by global average pooling and dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. Images were resized to 128Ã—128 pixels and normalized, with no additional augmentation needed. We trained the model using class weights to address imbalance and applied early stopping to avoid overfitting. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 97.21% and a test accuracy of 97.23%, showing strong and consistent performance. These results suggest that our approach can be a practical and efficient solution for real-time plant disease detection, especially in resource-limited agricultural settings.
